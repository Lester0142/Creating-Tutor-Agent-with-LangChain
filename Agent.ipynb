The pooling operation is typically performed using hard-coded pooling layers, and the most commonly used pooling function is the max pooling, which selects the maximum value from a 2x2 window of activations.

      "THIS IS NOT THE STUDENT's ANSWER, THIS IS THE LECTURE MATERIAL: Batch normalization is a technique used in neural networks to improve their performance. It works by normalizing the inputs of each layer in a mini-batch, which helps in reducing the internal covariate shift.\n",

      "The internal covariate shift refers to the change in the distribution of the input values to each layer during training. This shift can make it difficult for the network to learn effectively. Batch normalization addresses this issue by normalizing the inputs to each layer, making the distribution more stable.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Compute the mean and variance of the inputs in a mini-batch.\n",
      "2. Normalize the inputs by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.\n",
      "3. Scale and shift the normalized inputs using learnable parameters (gamma and beta) to allow the network to learn the optimal scale and shift for each layer.\n",
      "\n",
      "By normalizing the inputs, batch normalization helps in reducing the dependence of the network on the scale and distribution of the input data. This makes the network more robust and allows for faster convergence during training.\n",

      "Additionally, batch normalization acts as a regularizer by adding some noise to the inputs, which can help in reducing overfitting. It also reduces the need for careful initialization of the network's weights.\n",

In this approach, the policy network is trained by sampling roll-outs, which are sequences of actions taken by the policy network in an environment. The expected discounted cumulative reward is then computed for each roll-out. The policy network is updated by taking the gradient of the expected cumulative reward with respect to the network's parameters and using it to update the network's weights.
